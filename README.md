- 💞️ Hi, I’m Piyali
- 🌱 I’m interested in Animals and poor people
- 💃 I’m currently learning how not to worry to much
- 📒 I’m looking to collaborate on being human and let people do what they love and not code for the sake of it
- 📫 How to reach me - cpiyac@gmail.com
- 👀 I have had multiple github accounts earlier with zero projects in them
- ❤️‍🩹 Hopefully, I learn to stick and make others life easier with code written literally in English language (like pseudo code!)
